# Item3_CloudChat

My project is a networked cloud server connecting clients to ajust the outflow of a dam
its done by a clients computer connects to a cloud server and can send commands which then gets encrypted and sent to the dam which proccesses the command and sends a conformation back still encrypted and then to the client again
But if a computer could be connected to the dams network just being able to read the packets being sent through even though they are encrypted they can be analised and abused due to no other security
